    <h2>What are Drugs?</h2>

        <li><strong>Stimulants:</strong> Drugs that increase activity in the central nervous system, leading to heightened alertness, energy, and euphoria. Examples include cocaine, amphetamines, and caffeine.</li>
        <li><strong>Hallucinogens:</strong> Drugs that alter perception, mood, and thought processes, often leading to hallucinations and profound changes in consciousness. Examples include LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and MDMA (ecstasy).</li>
        <li><strong>Cannabis:</strong> A group of drugs derived from the Cannabis plant, with various psychoactive effects. The main psychoactive compound is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).</li>
        <li><strong>Others:</strong> This category includes a wide range of substances with diverse effects, such as inhalants, dissociatives, and prescription medications.</li>
    </ul>
